Module 5 Challenge - Matplotlib &amp; Statistics

# Overview

    In this challenge, we analyzed some data from Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specialized in anti-cancer medications, and their potential treatment for skin cancer.

    The study covered 249 mice and measured their tumor volume over 45 days to determine the most promising treatment regimen.

        In this challenge, we first prepared the data by putting it into a dataframe, checking for duplicates, and cleaning the data.

        Then we generated some summary statistics to determine a subset of the most promising treatments, including the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM for each drug treatment.

        We then took a subset of the treatments and further analyzed by creating bar and pie charts, boxplots, and scatter plots and calculated quartiles and outlers for each drug.

    Based on this dataset, we can draw multiple conclusions on the most promising treatments.
